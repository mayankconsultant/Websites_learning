            I have worked for quiet good numbers of telecom operators
            understanding their business, their marketing needs and customer
            requirments. Additionally I have worked with some reputed vendors
            where I have learned system based technical features and its
            limitations. I have successfully done migrations from legacy system
            to BSCS, not only have I been innovative in solving operational
            issues, but also I have been keen to automate daily routine tasks.

            As a hobby, I love to write Poems, learn new technology, and
            research stocks and funds. My Wife is a teacher, being my better
            behalf, We have an adorable son, persuing his studies in primary
            school. Thats me and my family.

            In a nutshell,I consider myself a good candidate to resolve
            challenges, to lead team, or even to design solutions. Currently am
            passionate about Python, although my skills are more proven in
            Oracle, shell scripting and Pl/Sql. I am an avid learner with no
            remorse for learning any technical area or field.
